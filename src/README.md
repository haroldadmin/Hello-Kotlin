## Hello, Kotlin

This is a companion repository to my Hello, Kotlin! presentation. Please find a link for that here:
[Presentation](https://speakerdeck.com/haroldadmin/hello-kotlin)

Contains code samples to teach Kotlin to programming beginners. Assumes only very basic understanding of variables and functions in any other language, such as C++ or Java.

I shall add more samples here as I improve the presentation :)
